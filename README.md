# pan_ticker
This hi-end, hi-fi, hi-tech ticker for the Pantos multi-blockchain cryptocurrency token uses several codings and much algorithm to access top-secret data from the Bitpanda website, process these data into floating points and display the unencrypted bits in HD on your command line. Use at own risk. 

tl;dr: It's a super-simple price ticker for PAN.

If this or anything on my GitHub helped you, informed you or made you smile, or if you've just got some superfluous bitcoin lying around, feel free to drop a penny into this bitcoin fountain: 385GUu3BjjpkijKS2aFU2t4NqvmFXdnX9x
